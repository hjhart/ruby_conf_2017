# Ruby Conf 2017 Notes

# Keynote from Mats
When migrating from, say, Ruby 1.8 ato Ruby 1.9, some people will leave the language because the newer version is incompatible.
Second System Syndrome

# Aja Hammerly

Based on CS60

## Object Oriented

You know, ruby.

## Functional programming, using RACKET
LISP is second oldest language, to FORTRAN

Functional never stores state.
State and behavior are separate.

Testing can be simpler because you don't need to set state, just pass in data to a function.

## Prolog - Logic Constraints

Q: How many Prolog developers does it take to screw in a lightbulb?
A: No.

The _ in prolog is called "meh", which Aja likes. :)

I can't... follow... this code. Would be advised to read through the slides again for the Prolog definition.

## Procedural - Assembly

A register and D register.

Strengths? None.

There are some other reading materials that she'd recommend in her slides, [here](http://thagomizer.com/talks/rubyconf_17.html)


# Nate Kerbal Space Program

An object in rotation is stable on two axis but not on the third.  Whaaaaaat?

kRPC is the API for Kerbal Space Program.

Sounding Rockets would shoot up in the air, collect data, and then it would come back down.. Aerobee 150A.

Hot staging, fire stage two boosters before stage one is done so that the G's don't go down to zero while stage two reaches maximum thrust.

Talked all about the AGC, Apollo Guidance Computer. 

Some great history on the Apollo mission to the moon, the team that wrote the software, and good videos.

# Jeff Saks

Jrsacks- alexa and tv remote
Talk about Alexa / Echo and programming his TV remote

# Talk about Functional programming rewriting rack


Pretty great little talk about Procs and lambdas and clojure as an interesting language.

# keynote at night

“Code like sandi Metz is standing over your shoulder watching”
Always be recycling code. Always be deploying. Uptime of more than a couple of hours is “terrifying”
